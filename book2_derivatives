Reading 15-16

1. option basics
- option value = intrinsic value + time value
  option value = f(S, X, T, rf, sigma), all can be almost certain except sigma, which is the core of pricing
- profits = payoff - premium
- synthetic asset
  forward = call -  put
  call = asset + put
  
2. option strategies
- covered call = asset - call
  expectation: stock will rise, but to a certain degree
  profit = (St - S0) - max(0, St-X) + c
  [1] yield enhancement
  short deep OTM call, collect premium
  [2] reduce position
  short ITM call, close in the near future
  [3] target price realization
  short OTM call, close in the future
  
- protective put = asset + put
  expectation: stock will rise, but do not want to lose
  profit = (St - S0) + max(0, X-St) - p
  
- collar = asset - call + put
  profit = (St - S0) + max(0, Xp-St) - max(0, St-Xc) - p + c
  expectation: stock will rise, do not want to lose, but do not want to pay premium

- bull call = call_low - call high (reduce fee)
  bull put = - put_high + put_low (control risk)
  bear put = put_high - put_low (reduce fee)
  bear call = - call_low + call high (control risk)
  
- straddle = call + put @ same maturity and X

- calendar spread = long-term option - short-term option
  which longs the "forward volatility", as time value decays more in short-term than long-term

- by volatility
  high: long call/put
  low: short call/put
  mid: long and short call/put
  
3. greeks (option price change / ...)
[1] delta - underlying
    c = S*N(d1) - K*exp(-rT)*N(d2) 
    p = S*N(-d1) - K*exp(-rT)*N(-d2)
    delta_call = N(d1) ~ (0,1)
    delta_put = N(-d1) ~ (-1,0)
    draw option value ~ X, delta_OTM = 0, 1 = abs delta ITM
[2] vega > 0 - volatility
[3] rho - risk-free rate
    rho_call > 0
    rho_put < 0
[4] theta < 0 - passage of time
    except for deep ITM put
[5] gamma - delta ~ underlying
    draw option value ~ X
    call: delta from 0 to 1, put: from -1 to 0
    for both, gamma > 0, largest ATM
