Reading 15-16

1. option basics
- option value = intrinsic value + time value
  option value = f(S, X, T, rf, sigma), all can be almost certain except sigma, which is the core of pricing
- profits = payoff - premium
- synthetic asset
  forward = call -  put
  call = asset + put
  
2. option strategies
- covered call = asset - call
  expectation: stock will rise, but to a certain degree
  profit = (St - S0) - max(0, St-X) + c
  [1] yield enhancement
  short deep OTM call, collect premium
  [2] reduce position
  short ITM call, close in the near future
  [3] target price realization
  short OTM call, close in the future
  
- protective put = asset + put
  expectation: stock will rise, but do not want to lose
  profit = (St - S0) + max(0, X-St) - p
  
- collar = asset - call + put
  profit = (St - S0) + max(0, Xp-St) - max(0, St-Xc) - p + c
  expectation: stock will rise, do not want to lose, but do not want to pay premium

- bull call = call_low - call high (reduce fee)
  bull put = - put_high + put_low (control risk)
  bear put = put_high - put_low (reduce fee)
  bear call = - call_low + call high (control risk)
