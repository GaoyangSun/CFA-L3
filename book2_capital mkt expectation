Reading 10-11

1. challenges in forecasting
[1] limitations to econmic data
    time lag/ revision/ rebase
[2] data measurement errors and biases
    survivorship bias/ appraisal data - under-estimated variance and correlation with other
[3] limitations of historical estimates
    non-stationary data comes from regime changes
[4] ex post risk as a biased risk measure of ex ante risk
[5] biases in analysts' method
    data-mining/ time-period bias (specific period)
[6] failure to account for conditioning info
[7] misinterpretation of correlations
[8] psychological biases
[9] model uncertainty

2. analysis of economic growth
- exogenous shocks
  unanticipated, can cause regime changes
  can be caused by government policy/political event/technology/natural disaster/natural resources/GFC
  
3. decomposition of GDP growth
Y = A * K^alpha * L^beta (alpha + beta = 1)
A: total factor productivity
K: capital per worker
L: labor input

4. anchoring asset returns to trend growth
mkt value of equity V = GDP * (earnings/GDP) * PE
d_V% = d_GDP% + d_S% + d_PE% + d_divdend%

5. approaches to economic forecsting
[1] econometric modeling
    structural models / reduced-form models
    pros: many variables/ reusable models/ quantified
    cons: complex and time-consuming/ relationship can change/ open to interpretation
[2] economic indicators
    leading (monetary supply, PMI) / coincident (GDP)/ lagging (inflation)
    pros: simple and intuitive/ available
    cons: inconsistent indicators/ false signals
[3] checklist approach
    pros' opinion
    pros: less complex/ flexible
    cons: subjective/ time-consuming
    
6. business cycle
   output gap = potential GDP - acutal GDP
   [1] initial recovery
   falling inflation, large output gap, bond yields botttom out, stock price rise
   [2] early expansion
   low inflation, bond yield rise a little, stock price rise
   [3] late expansion
   0 output gap, increasing inflation, bond yield rise, stock price peaks
   [4] slowdown
   increasing inflation, bond yield peaks (possible inverting yield curve), stock price falls
   inverting yield curve because of tightening monetary policy (rising short-term) and fisical policy (decrease long-term)
   [5] recession
   inflation peaks and falls, bond yield falls, stock price may rise in the end

7. monetary policy
goal - long-run sustainable growth - balance between growth and inflation
neutral rate - equlibrium int rate = real-growth + inflation
Taylor rule
target = (real_neutral rate + inflation) + 
         0.5*(expected real growth - target real growth) + 
         0.5*(expected inflation - target inflation)
         
8. fisical policy
tax and government spending
budget deficit = fisical policy + business cycle
- on int rate (after the policy has taken effect)
monetary affects inflation, fisical affects real rate
loose monetary - high inflation, loose fisical - high real rates
- on yield curve (during the policy)
monetary affects short-term yield largely, fisical affects long-term yield mildly
loose monetary - lower short-term yield, loose fisical - high long-term rate

9. forecast risk and return
- sample stat
- shrinkage estimate (weighted between historical var and analyst var)
- time-series estimate (ARCH/GARCH)
- multi-factor

- DCF
- risk premium

10. forecast FI return
[1] DCF
may fail to achieve YTM
sell bond prior to maturity/ changing reinvestment return/ IH > MacDuration (reinvestment risk > price risk, not immunized)

[2] risk premium
r = rf + term premium + credit premium + liquidity premium
- term premium (positively related to duration)
  inflation uncertainty 
  recession hedge (demand-driven inflation:good/ supply-driven inflation:bad)
  supply and demand
  business cycle
- credit premium
  expected default loss
- liquidity premium

11. forecast equity return
[1] DCF - Grinold and Kroner 
originally, r = (D1/P0) + g
after revision, r = (D1/P0 - d%Shares) + d%Earnings + d%P/E
income return: dividend + sales (as repurchase)
earnings growth return: d%Earnings
repricing return: d%P/E

[2] risk premium - Singer-Terhaar model
originally, risk premium RP_i = beta(i,m)*RP_mkt
fully global, RP_(i,glb) = beta(i,glb)*RP_glb
fully segmented, RP_(i,sgm) = beta(i,sgm)*RP_sgm
                            = cor(i,sgm)*(std(i)/std(sgm))*RP_sgm
                            = std(i)*(RP_glb/std(glb))
combine, RP_i = phi*RP_(i,glb) + (1-phi)*RP_(i,sgm)

12. forecast real estate
higher quality properties are less cyclical
[1] DCF
P0 = NOI1(net operating income)/(r-g)
cap rate: NOI1/P0  or  r-g
r = (NOI1/P0) + g = cap rate + NOI growth rate
in fintie period
r = cap rate + NOI growth rate - d%cap rate
(- d%cap rate) - capital gain, as P0 increase if cap rate decrease
cap rate - positively related to int rate and vacancy
           inversely related to availability of debt (P0)

[2] risk premium
r = rf + term premium + credit premium + equity risk premium + liquidity premium

13. forecasting FX
affected by trade flows/ purchasing power parity/ current account and exchange rate
capital mobility
d%S(d,f) = (rd-rf) + (term_d - term_f) + (credit_d - credit_f) + (equity_d - equity_f) + (liquid_d - liquid_f)
         = (risk-premium defined) int rate_d - int rate_f
uncovered int rate parity (UIP)
d%S(d,f) = rf(d) - rf(f)
