disposition effect (sell winners and hold on to losers)

social proof (peer pressure)

adaptive mkt hypothesis (AMH) -> apply heuristics until they no long work, and then adjust

recalability trap -> overweight castrophic/dramatic event

factorâ€”based model - construct the frontier of risk factors, run the optimized combo, then map back to assets

risk budgetting -> excess return to MCTR = (expected return - risk-free rate)/MCTR

Integrated asset-liability approach -> take liability as a variable
Surplus efficient frontier approach/Two-portfolio approach -> take the liabilities as a given and only focus on managing the assets

shrinkage estimate (weighted between historical var and analyst var)

uncovered int rate parity (UIP) -> d%S(d,f) = rf(d) - rf(f)

Dornbusch overshooting -> countries with higher investment return will attract capital with higher expectation, s.t. it will overshoot can depreciate a little in the end
