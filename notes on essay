Behavioral finance
0. when given the name of bias to decide client's possible action, place more weight in the meaning of bias than which category it belongs to
   e.g. people with availability bias are harder to change, despite it is a cognitive error
1. heurstics/rule of thumb -> when you do something from hearsay or easy rule
2. herding -> actions often caused by regret aversion
3. state a cognitive bias to belief perservance (RICCH) or information-processing (FAMA)

Economics
1. permanent income hypothesis 
   consumer spending is based on long-term predictions of income, short-term deviations (GDP decrease) does not affect the spending
2. G-K model (alternative)
   d%Y = d%A + alpha*d%K + (1-alpha)*d%L
   A -> total factor productivity / K -> growth in capital stock / L -> growth in labor input
   alpha -> output elasticity of capital / 1-alpha -> output elasticity of labor
3. factors may positively affect inflation
   consumer confidence index / inventory/sales / GDP output gap (actual GDP - potential GDP)/potential GDP
   
Individual
1. life-insurance, trust and charity can reduce total estate, resulting in a lower future estate tax
2. factors that increase ability to take risk
   -> long horizon(10 yrs or longer)/ stable income and expense (net savers)/ mortgage-free house/ fully vested pension plan
   factors that decrease ability to take risk
   -> short horizon/ concentrated position/ reduced human capital (disability)/ donation (or other cash outflow)/ small asset base
   with passage of time, factors that may have changed
   -> shorter horizon/ larger asset base/ accomplished cash outflow
3. accural equivalent tax rate
   -> calculate after-tax return r_at = (FV_at/PV) xexp (1/T) - 1
   -> calculate equivalent tax rate ->  T_ae = 1 - (r_at/r_pt)
4. tax liability = tax base * tax rate
5. pay attention to the timing of cash flow (coming year, then inflation not considered) 
                and the nature of cash flow (if it is taxable)
6. IPS for time-horizon 
   long/short, how many stages
7. IPS for uniqueness
   personal investment outside advisor-managed portfolio
8. shortfall risk = pre-tax nominal return - 2*nominal standard deviation
9. CFA calculator can input PV and PMT
10. pro of MCS -> simulate the probaility of distribution, allowing the client to determine the likelihood of accomplishing his goals
                  can consider multi-period effect of tax changes (if there is any)
    con of MCS -> does not reflect expection/ long period data subject to regime changes
11. conversion from DB to DC shifts risk to employees, therefore increasing their longevity risk
12. mortgage financing. net proceeds =  asset value * LTV

Institutional
1. factors that increase ability to take risk
   for foundations or endowment, goals like funding a project or meet min spending rate, are just goals, not binding requirement
2. liquidity requirement decrease the ability to take risk and require higher cash reverse, despite it would reduce return
3. a hire freeze or decrease minimum retirement age would shorten the investment horizon
4. fewer people in a pension plan would increase the liability noise, because acturial model follows law of large numbers
5. when comparing projects to take, take the one with lower required rate of return, giving it some cushion for volatilies in return or other variables (inflation)
6. a general spending rate can take more risks than a specific purpose

Asset allocation
1. to ALM or not to ALM
   to -> fix-amt considered as liability
   not to -> floting-amt(5%) not considered as liability/ willingness to operate in perpetuity by investing in higher return
2. to MCS or MVO
   to MCS -> multi-period framework considering a lot of variables
             rebalacning policy can be incorporated
             non-nornam distribution properties like skewness can incorporated

Equity
1. to full replication or to stratified sampling
   if the benchmark has high liquidity and low number of stocks (IH) -> better to use full replication
