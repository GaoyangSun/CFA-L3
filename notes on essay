Economics
1. permanent income hypothesis 
   consumer spending is based on long-term predictions of income, short-term deviations (GDP decrease) does not affect the spending
2. G-K model (alternative)
   d%Y = d%A + alpha*d%K + (1-alpha)*d%L
   A -> total factor productivity / K -> growth in capital stock / L -> growth in labor input
   alpha -> output elasticity of capital / 1-alpha -> output elasticity of labor
3. factors may positively affect inflation
   consumer confidence index / inventory/sales / GDP output gap (actual GDP - potential GDP)/potential GDP
