Reading 7-9
1. traditional finance v. behavioral finance
- traditional
  people are risk-averse, self-interested, utility maximizers (rational)
  people make decisions with utility theory, revise expectations with Bayes' formula
  people have access to perfect info, and can process it in an unbiased way
  price reflect all available and relevant info
- behavioral
  people are loss-averse, satisfying, with bounded rationality

2. decision-making process
[1] normative analysis
    rational solution - traditional 
[2] descriptive analysis 
    real people work - behavioral 
[3] prescriptive analysis
    predict results - behavioral
    
3. utility theory - traditional
four axioms of utility
- completeness 
  known choices and preferences
- transitivity
  consistent rankings
- independence
  additive and divisible utilities
- continuity
  smooth and unbroken indifference curves
  
4. challenges to traditional finance
- bounded rationality/ difficulty prioritizing short-term goals/ not perfect info
  not constantly risk-averse (lottery and insurance)
  Friedman-Savage double-inflection utility function: concave (risk-averse) at sides, convex (risk-seeking) in the middle
  
5. prospect theory
- risk-averse gain, risk-seeking loss (people are loss-aversion)
- editing process (early phase) + evaluation process (later phase)
- editing process
  codification/ combination/ segregation/ cancellation/ simplification/ detection of dominace

6. EMH
- weak-form
  mkt info are assumed, technical analysis do not work
- semi-strong form
  mkt and fundamental info are assumed, fundamental analysis do not work
- strong form  
  all info are assumed, nothing will work
  
7. mkt anomalies
- fundamental - size effect/ value effect
- tech - moving averages/ support and resistance
- calendar - January effect

8. four behavioral finance models
[1] consumption and savings
- framing (how do you say sth.)
- self-control (short-term spending)
- mental accounting (salary and bonus)
[2] behavioral asset pricing
discount rate on security = risk-free rate + fundamental risk premium + sentiment premium
[3] behavioral portfolio theory (BPT)
construct portfolios in layers by expectations of the performance (goal-based/pyramid/mentail accouting)
[4] adaptive mkts hypothesis
success is survival, rather than maximizing utility (because things change)
