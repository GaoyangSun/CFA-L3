Reading 12 - 14

1. investment governance
- governance hierarchy
  investment committee - approve, delegate, oversight, audit
  investment staff - draft, research, evaluate, create, assess
  third-party resources - consult
- governance models
  
2. enonmic balance sheet
- asset
  domestic equity + PV of expected future income
- libility
  sohort-term borrowing + PV of expected future consumption
- equtiy
  economic net worth
  
3. approaches to asset allocation
- asset-only
  for ones without debts
  risk measure: volatility/tracking error/max drawdown/VaR
- ALM
  for most institutional investors
  risk measure: shortfall risk
- goal-based
  for individual
  risk measure: prob(not achieve goal)
  
4. asset classes
criteria: homogeneous (within)/ mutually exclusive/ diversifying/ largely exhaustive

5. isolate risk factor (pure-factor portfolio)
- inflation
  long nominal Treasuries, short inflation-linked bond
- real int rates
  inflation-linked bond
- US volatility
  VIX future
- credit spread
  long high-spread bond, short Treasuries
- duration
  long 10-year Treasuies, short 1-year Treasuries
 
6. strategic asset allocation
 - TAA (tactical)
   short-term deviation
 - DAA (dynamic)
   long-term changes due to changes in CME
   
7. rebalancing
 - calendar/ percent-range (trigger points or range)
 - range are affected by (wider range - less likely to rebalance)
   transanction cost/ risk-aversion/ asset class correlation/ belief in mean-reversion/ liquidity/ volatility/ taxes
 - effects
   better diversification/ short volatility

8. asset-only
MVO
- no short selling
  i.e. not negative weights, some points on the frontier are not attainable
  interpolation may be used to synthesize the target return
- with risk-free asset
  choose a portfolio on the frontier, with which it forms the highest sharpe ratio
cons:  
- highly concentrated   (add constraints)
- highly sensitive to inputs (resamplesd MVO, reversed MVO, BL)
  resampled MVO = MVO + MCS - run many frontiers, then average
  cons: could have concave bumps/ over-diversifed/ inherit the estimation errors/ no foundation in theory
  reversed MVO: use global portfolio wgts to reversely calculate implied risk and return
- not account for skewness and kurtosis (non-normal optimization)
  mean-semivariance/ mean-conditional VaR/ mean-variance-skewness-kurtosis
- liquidity
  exclude less liquid asset/ replace with liquid similar asset
- risk factor may not be diversified (risk-budgeting and factor-based model)
  factorâ€”based model - construct the frontier of risk factors, run the optimized combo, then map back to asstes
- single-period framework (MCS method)
  cons: frequent rebalancing/ path dependent (next path depends on previous path)
- not account for liability or consumption

9. ALM
[1] surplus optimization
surplus return = (d_asset - d_liability)/asset
- return of liability use corporate bond as proxy
- compare to AO, ALM could have negative-value frontier, risk-free asset is corporate bond
[2] hedging/return-seeking portfolio approach
hedging covers liability, return-seeking is managed separately
may require an over-funded status
