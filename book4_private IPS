Reading 28-32

1. understanding private client
[1] info needed
- personal info
  family/marital status/children
  proof of client ID
  employment and career info/ source of client wealth
  investment background - return/liquidity/ESG
  financial objectives and risk tolerance
- financial info
  assets/ liabilities
- tax considerations
  tax on income/ wealth/ consumption
  tax avoidance/ reduction/ deferral
[2] client goals
- planned goals (can be reasonably estimated)
  retirement/ specific purchases/ education/ family events/ wealth transfer/ philanthropy
- unplanned goals (timing or amount cannot be esimated)
  property repairs/ medical expenses
[3] private client risk tolerance
- risk tolerance (willingness)
  reflected by: past investment/ emotion/ self-assessment
- risk capacity (ability)
  reflected by: importance, amount, and investment horizon of goals
[4] technical and soft skills for wealth managers


2. return calculation
[1] next year's return and maintain real value of investment
    CF needs / TIA (total investable asset) + inflation
    assumptions:
    - salary/expense happens at the end of period
    - current portfolio can be cashed without cost
    - all TIA and expenses are after-tax
    - living expense and intuition often account for inflation
[2] return for next 10 years
    IRR
[3] similar to [1], but TIA is in the future
    - you may have to estimate the return of the current portfolio

3. investment planning
[1] capital sufficiency analysis
- straight-line
  assume a deterministic growth
  con: unrealistic w.r.t variability in future outcomes
- MCS
[2] retirement planning
- mortality table
- annuities
- MCS
- biases
  consumption gaps: retirees spend less than expected
  annuity puzzle: individuals tend not to invest in annuities

4. IPS
[1] background and investment objectives
    detailed and quantified objectives
[2] investment parameters
    risk tolerance and capacity/ time horizon/ asset class preference
    liquidity preference - short-term gap (inflow - outflow)
[3] portfolio asset allocation
    SAA + TAA
[4] portfolio mgt
    - discretionary authority (full discretion - trade without approval)
    - rebalancing (time-based/ threshold-based)
    - tactical changes
    - implementation (third-parth money managers/ proprietary investment)
[5] duties and responsibilities
    - IPS review (at least annually)
[6] IPS Appendix
    - modeled portfolio behavior
    - capital mkt expectations
 
5. portfolio construction and monitoring
[1] portfolio construction
    traditional approach/ goal-based investing approach
[2] portfolio reporting and review
    portfolio reporting/ portfolio review
[3] evaluating the success of an investment program
    - goal achievement
    meet long-term objective with an acceptable amount of risk
    - process consistency
    good recommendation for third-party manager/ follow the prescribed process for rebalancing/ reduce cost
    - portfolio performance
    better than benchmark
    - definitions of success
    pre-agreed criteria

6. ethical and compliance consideration
- fiduciary duty and suitability
- KYC
- confidentiality
- conflicts of interest

7. private client segments
[1] mass affluent segment (0.25 - 1mil)
    not customize
[2] high-net-worth (1 - 50 mil)
    customized investment mgt, tax planning, wealth transfer issues
[3] ultra-high-net-worth (>50 mil)
    multi-generational time horizons, complext tax, estate planing, anything
[4] robo-advisors (<0.25mil)

8. tax calculation
[1] simple tax
- accrual taxation (every year on income)
  FV = (1 + r - r*t)^n = (1+r*(1-t))^n
  tax drag = (FV_pt - FV_at)/(FV_pt - I_0) - reduction in return due to tax on capital gain
  - tax drag > tax rate  (compounded tax)
  - tax drag increase as investment horizon increase
  - tax drag increase as investment return increase
- deferred capital gain (one-time on gain)
  FV = (1+r)^n - ((1+r)^n - 1)*t
     = (1+r)^n*(1-t) + t
  tax drag = ((1+r)^n - 1)*t
  - tax drag = tax rate
  when you bought sth from past, and it cost B instead of 1
  FV = (1+r)^n - ((1+r)^n - 1)*t - (1-B)*t
     = (1+r)^n*(1-t) + B*t
- wealth-based (every year on wealth)
  FV = [(1+r)(1-t)]^n
  - tax drag > tax rate
  - tax drag increase as investment horizion increase
  - tax drag$ increase, tax drag% decrease as investment return increase
[2] blended tax
return on a portfolio can be divided into: interest + dividend + realized capital gain(RCG) + unrealized capital gain(UCG)
UCG of which can be deferred, int + div + rcg + ucg = 100% (total return)

return after realized tax R_art = r*(1 - int*t_int - div*t_div - rcg*t_cg)
effective capital gain tax rate on ucg t_ecg * [1- int*t_int - div*t_div - rcg*t_cg] = t_cg * ucg
FV = (1+r_art)^n - ((1+r_art)^n-1)*t_ecg - (1-B)*t_cg

[3] accrual equivlent tax rate (t_ae) and return (r_ae)
r_ae = r_pt*(1-t_ae)

9. types of investment accounts
[1] taxable account
    after-(ordinary) tax in, taxed during trading
    FV = (1+r*(1-t))^n
[2] tax-deferred account
    before-(ordinary) tax in, taxed @ withdraw
    FV = (1+r)^n * (1 - t_withdrawn)
[3] tax-exempt account
    after-(ordinary) tax in, no tax during or withdraw
    FV = (1+r)^n
    
10. tax alpha
[1] tax location
put equity in taxable (stock's capital gain are inherently tax-deferred), put bond in tax-deferred (int happend every year)
[2] time period mgt
capital gain tax rate =17% if horizon<1 yr, 7% of horizon>1 yr
[3] tax loss harvesting
realize unrealized loss, to lower tax
[4] HIFO
sell the security with highest cost
