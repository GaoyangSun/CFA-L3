      underfunded - return on asset > actuarial discount rate (you have to make higher return to meet deficit/ or make additional contributions)
    - secondary objective
      minimize pv of expected cash contributions
[6] liquidity needs
    active v. retired/ age of workforce/ funded status/ withdraw when switch jobs
