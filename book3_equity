Reading 22-25

1. role of equity in a portfolio
capital appreciation/ dividend income/ diversification/ inflation hedge
negative screening/ positive screening/ thematic investing

2. equity universe
- by size and style
large/mid/small * value/blend/growth
con: size and style drift
- by location
developed/ emerging/ froniter
con: currency risk/ overestimation of diversification
- by economic activity
mkt-oriented/ production-oriented
con: hard to assgin big complex company to one sector
- by equity indices and benchmarks

3. income of equity
- capital appreciation (no or low tax)
- dividend (high tax)
- securities lending
- covered-call (stock - call) / cash-covered put (cash - put)
- dividend capture

4. cost of equity
- mgt fees + performance fees (high water marks)
- admin fees (custody/ depository/ registration)
- trading cost (explict + implict)
- investment strategy cost (momentum strategies - demand liqudity/ contrarian strategy - supply liquidity)

5. shareholder engagement
- corporate strategy/ capital allocation/ governance/ compensation/ board of directors
- cons: focus on short-term/ non-public info/ conflicts of interest

6. active or positive?
- confidence/ client preferences/ ESG
- risk for active mgt
  reputation risk/ key person risk/ higher portfolio turnover (tax burdens)
  
7. index
- rule-based/ transparent/ investable
- buffering (breakpoint)/ packeting (split between indices)
- determine the mkt exposure
  mkt segment/ capitalization/ style
- construct and maintain
  weighting: mkt-cap(liquidity)/ price/ equal/ fundamental
  rebalancing/ reconsitution
- stock concentration
  HHI = sum over w_i^2
  effective no. of stocks = 1/HHI 
  
8. vehicles for passive equity
- pooled investment
  ETF
- derivatives based
  to rebalance the portfolio using stock futures
  compeletion overlay(adjust beta)/ rebalancing overlay(adjust stock)/ currency overlay
  cons: basis risk/ position limits
- separately managed account

9. passive portfolio construction
- full replication
  U-shaped tracking error as no. of stocks increase = decreasing tracking error + increasinig trading cost
- stratified sampling
  sample by fundamental styles (exclusive and exhaustive)
- optimization
  factor-based replication: lowest tracking error
  tracking error is a trade-off between benefits of larger sample size and increased costs
- blended approach
- factor-based semi-active (smart beta)
  factor: growth-value/ size/ div yield/ momentum/ quality/ volatility
  alter certain factor exposures
  return-oriented: div yield, momentum
  risk-oriented: volatility-weighting, minimum-variance investing
  diversfication-oriented: equal-weighting, max-diversification weighting
  
10. active - bottom up
