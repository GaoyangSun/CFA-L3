Reading 22-25

1. role of equity in a portfolio
capital appreciation/ dividend income/ diversification/ inflation hedge
negative screening/ positive screening/ thematic investing

2. equity universe
- by size and style
large/mid/small * value/blend/growth
con: size and style drift
- by location
developed/ emerging/ froniter
con: currency risk/ overestimation of diversification
- by economic activity
mkt-oriented/ production-oriented
con: hard to assgin big complex company to one sector
- by equity indices and benchmarks

3. income of equity
- capital appreciation (no or low tax)
- dividend (high tax)
- securities lending
- covered-call (stock - call) / cash-covered put (cash - put)
- dividend capture

4. cost of equity
- mgt fees + performance fees (high water marks)
- admin fees (custody/ depository/ registration)
- trading cost (explict + implict)
- investment strategy cost (momentum strategies - demand liqudity/ contrarian strategy - supply liquidity)

5. shareholder engagement
- corporate strategy/ capital allocation/ governance/ compensation/ board of directors
- cons: focus on short-term/ non-public info/ conflicts of interest

6. active or positive?
- confidence/ client preferences/ ESG
- risk for active mgt
  reputation risk/ key person risk/ higher portfolio turnover (tax burdens)
  
7. index
- rule-based/ transparent/ investable
- buffering (breakpoint)/ packeting (split between indices)
- determine the mkt exposure
  mkt segment/ capitalization/ style
- construct and maintain
  weighting: mkt-cap(liquidity)/ price/ equal/ fundamental
  rebalancing/ reconsitution
- stock concentration
  HHI = sum over w_i^2
  effective no. of stocks = 1/HHI 
  
8. vehicles for passive equity
- pooled investment
  ETF
- derivatives based
  to rebalance the portfolio using stock futures
  compeletion overlay(adjust beta)/ rebalancing overlay(adjust stock)/ currency overlay
  cons: basis risk/ position limits
- separately managed account

9. passive portfolio construction
- full replication
  U-shaped tracking error as no. of stocks increase = decreasing tracking error + increasinig trading cost
- stratified sampling
  sample by fundamental styles (exclusive and exhaustive)
- optimization
  factor-based replication: lowest tracking error
  tracking error is a trade-off between benefits of larger sample size and increased costs
- blended approach
- factor-based semi-active (smart beta)
  factor: growth-value/ size/ div yield/ momentum/ quality/ volatility
  alter certain factor exposures
  return-oriented: div yield, momentum
  risk-oriented: volatility-weighting, minimum-variance investing
  diversfication-oriented: equal-weighting, max-diversification weighting
  
10. active strategies
[1] top down - CME/ asset class
[2] bottom up - fundamental
- value based
relative value/ contrarian investing/ income (divdend) investing/ high-quality value
deep-value (low PE/distressed) investing/ restructuring and distressed debt/ special situations
- growth based
GARP (growth at a reasonable price)/ PEG (PE to growth)
[3] factor-based
- long/short
rewarded/unreward factor - q10 - q1
cons: nonlinear relation cannot be detected/ middel q overlooked/ exposure to other factors
- factor timing
equity style rotation
[4] others
- activist (minimal shareholder engagement)
- statistical arbitrage
- mkt microstructure
- pairs trading
- event-driven

11. style classification
[1] holdings-based
morningstar style box (size*value)
cons: style definitions may vary
[2] return-based
return of portfolio ~ indices
cons: extreme styles/ style drfit

12. source of active returns
rewarded factors / mispricing / idiosyncratic risk
Ra = sum over (beta_p - beta_b)*factor + alpha + epsilon
- building blocks of construction
  factor weighting + alpha skills + sizing positions
- fundamental law of active mgt
  E(Ra) = IC * sqrt(BR) * active risk * TC(transfer coef)
  
13. active share and risk
- active risk (tracking error)
  = sigma_factor + sigma_alpha
- active share (share deviation)
  = 1/2 * sum over |wgt_p,i - wgt_b,i|
- low to high
  pure indexing / closet indexing / factor-neutral&diversified stock picks / diversified factor bets / 
  concentrated factor bets / concentrated stock picks
  
14. risk budgeting
- absolute measure
  var_p = sum over w_i * w_j * cov_i,j
- relative measure
  TE_p = sum over (w_i - b_i) * (w_j - b_j) * Rcov_i,j
  
15. considerations in equity portfolio
- leverage
  R_geometric = R_arithmetic - sigma^2/2
- AUM / portfolio turnover&investment horizons / mkt impact 
- slippage
  time delay/mkt impact
  empirical studies: slippage higher than explicit/ higher in small-cap/ higher during high mkt volatility

16. what is a well-constructed portfolio
- can achieve desired risk exposures with fewer positions
- for similar risk factor exposures, have lower absolute/relative risk/ higher active share

17. long-only v. long-short
- gross exposure = long + short
  net exposure = long - short
- long extension portfolio = long 130 + short 30
- mkt neutral portfolio (pairs trading)
- short squeeze
  stock lender may require higher margin/collateral
