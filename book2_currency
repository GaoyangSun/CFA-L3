1. currency swaps
[1] cross-currency basis swap
    - you need a loan in fx - you borrow local, then swap it with fx
    - principals switched at the begining, int pmt not netted
    - basis stands for financial cost for using swap
[2] synthetic borrowing
    - you receice fx, change it into local - you swap it with local
    - no principals switched
    - swapRate_A = 3%, swapRate_B = 5% - NP_A * 3% = NP_B * 5%
    
2. currency forward and future 
- you need to exchange currency A to B @ pre-specified rate
- hedge ratio = amount of currency to be exchanged/future contract size

3. volatility derivatives
VIX - implied volatility in S&P 500 for 30 days
VIX return negatively correlates with equity return
- VIX futures - cannot buy spot VIX, buy futures
- variance swap
  fixed exchange for implied volatility^2
  settlement amt = notional variance * (sigma^2 - K^2)
  MtM variance valuation
  - expected variance = realized var*t/T + K^2*(T-t)/T
  - expected payoff = notional variance * (expected variance - K^2)
  - discount with rf
  
4. other derivatives
[1] fed funds futures
    contract price = 100 - expected FFE rate
[2] eurodollar futures
    contract price = 100 - future int rate
