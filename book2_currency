1. currency swaps
[1] cross-currency basis swap
    - you need a loan in fx - you borrow local, then swap it with fx
    - principals switched at the begining, int pmt not netted
    - basis stands for financial cost for using swap
[2] synthetic borrowing
    - you receice fx, change it into local - you swap it with local
    - no principals switched
    - swapRate_A = 3%, swapRate_B = 5% - NP_A * 3% = NP_B * 5%
    
2. currency forward and future 
- you need to exchange currency A to B @ pre-specified rate
- hedge ratio = amount of currency to be exchanged/future contract size

3. volatility derivatives
VIX - implied volatility in S&P 500 for 30 days
VIX return negatively correlates with equity return
- VIX futures - cannot buy spot VIX, buy futures
- variance swap
  fixed exchange for implied volatility^2
  settlement amt = notional variance * (sigma^2 - K^2)
  MtM variance valuation
  - expected variance = realized var*t/T + K^2*(T-t)/T
  - expected payoff = notional variance * (expected variance - K^2)
  - discount with rf
  
4. other derivatives
[1] fed funds futures
    contract price = 100 - expected FFE rate
[2] eurodollar futures
    contract price = 100 - future int rate
[3] CPI swaps
     
5. currency basics
- MtM value of a forward
  @ maturity - Vt = (St - FP) * contract size
  @ t - Vt = (FPt - FP0)*contract size/(1 + rf*(days/360))
- FX swap
  close the forward contract, open another one - roll forwards
- retuen decompose
  r_FC - foreign-currency return
  r_FX - change in currency pair
  r_DC - return in domestic perspective
  
  r_DC = (1+r_FC)(1+r_FX) - 1
  on portfolio, r_DC = sum over wi*(1+r_FCi)*(1+r_FXi) - 1
- variance decompose  
  var_DC = var_FC + var_FX + 2*sigma_FC*sigma_FX*correlation(FC, FX)
  
6. should you hedge FX risk?
[1] no hedge
    mean-reverting fundamental values
    zero-sum game
    management and transaction cost
[2] short-term: hedge, long-term: no hedge
    pricing inefficiencies in short term
    affected by international trade and capital flows in short term
    may be operated by central banks

7. IPS-related currency mgt are ignored

8. carry trade
- borrow low-yield currencies and invest in high-yield currencies
- covered int rate parity (CIRP)
  (F - S)/S = (i_P - i_B)/(1 + i_B) = i_P - i_B
  uncovered int rate parity (UIRP)
  
Note:
1. manager’s market views -> TAA
  correlation between asset and currency returns / investor’s time horizon, risk aversion, and liquidity needs -> SAA
2. EUR/KRW 0.00067/0.00068,  forward points –1.2/–1.1
   to short, 0.00068 - 1.1/100,000 (by the quote of 5-digit) -> 0.000669
3. R_dc = (1+R_fc) * (1+R_ret) - 1  -> do not use R_fc + R_ret
4. Currencies with higher relative interest rates tend to attract capital and appreciate in value
   Note that a common misconception is that the forward currency exchange rate is a valid predictor of what will happen to the value of a currency
5. gamma -> d_delta/d_S -> peaks @ ATM
6. a u.s. investor with euro stock
   to get rf_euro -> short euro futures
   to get tf_usd -> short euro futures and short euro forward
7. cross hedge -> underlying does not match
8. min variance hedge ratio -> euro stock return in terms of USD ~ b0 + b1*spot rate + epsilon
   where b1 -> MVHR -> cov(y,x)/var_y   -> riskier than one-on-one hedge as it is based on historical data
