Reading 34

1. motivations to trade
[1] profit seeking
- trade urgency/alpha decay
[2] risk mgt/hedging
[3] cash flow needs 
- to minimize cash drag, use equitization (long futures to gain stock exposure)
[4] corporate actions

2. inputs
[1] order characteristic
- side/ size/ relative size
[2] security characteristic
- security type/ short-term alpha/ price volatility
[3] mkt condition
- liquidity crises
- volatility and liquidity are negatively related
[4] trading cost risk aversion
- high risk aversion - shorter horizon - greater urgency
[5] mkt impact and execution risk
- trader's dilemma
  if you trade fast, high price impact
               slow, high execution risk (adverse mkt movement)
               
3. reference price
[1] pre-trade benchmarks 
- decision price/ prev close/ open (no overnight risk)/ arrival risk (latest)
[2] intraday benchmarks
- vwap
  rebalance over the day, have both buy and sell orders
- twap
  exclude potential trade outliers
[3] post-trade benchmarks
- close
  to minimize tracking error
[4] price target benchmarks
- self-defined
  support and resistance

4. trading strategies
- short-term alpha - high urgency
- long-term alpha - low urgency
- risk rebalance
- client redemption (cash outflow)
- new client mandate (cash inflow)

5. trade implementation choice
[1] higher-touch approach (with human)
- principal trade  (dealer)
- agency trade (broker)
- OTC/ RFQ(request for quotes)
[2] low-touch approach (automated)
- alternatice tradinig systems (ATS)
  non-exchange
- direct mkt access (DMA) 
  for derivatices and currency
- dark pools

6. algo trading
[1] execution algo - to reduce trading cost
    - scheduled POV (percent of volume) 
      pro: can automatically take advantage of increased liqudity
      con: higher trading cost/ may not complete
    - scheduled VWAP (based on yesterday's trading volume distribution by hour)
    - scheduled TWAP (equal-weighted time schedule)
      pro: time-slicing schedule
      con: not take advantage of liqudity condition
    - liquidity seeking
      trade faster @ favorable price
    - arrival price
      trade close to latest price, large amount at first
    - dark pools
    - smart order routers (SORs)
      highest probability of executing/best mkt price
[2] profit-seeking algo- to get alpha

7. comparison of mkts
[1] equity
large order - high-touch (human) / small order - low-touch (electronic)
urgent order - dealer / non-urgent order - broker
[2] FI 
traded in a bilateral, dealer-centric mkt structure, mostly high-touch
[3] derivatives - exchange
large urgent - sweep the book/ large non-urgent - electronic
small - direct mkt access (DMA)
[4] derivatives - OTC
high-touch, dealer for urgent, broker for non-urgent
[5] spot FX
large urgent - dealer (RFQ), large non-urgent - broker
samll - direct mkt access (DMA)

8. trade cost measurement
implmentation shortfall IS = paper return - actual return
both paper and actual return are -1+close/price_t

IS = execution cost + opportunity cost + fees
execution cost = (exec price - decision price)*exec volume
opportunity cost = (close - decision price)*(decision volume - exec volume)
execution cost = delay cost + trading cost 

9. trade evaluation
- cost in dollar per share
  (exec price - ref price) * side
- cost in total dollar
  (exec price - ref price) * side * shares
- cost in basis point
  (exec price - ref price)/decision * side * 10000bps
4 benchmarks for ref price
  arrival price/ vwap/ twap/ close
  
- mkt-adjusted cost
  to separate the trading cost due to mkt movement
  mkt-adjusted cost(bps) = arrival cost - beta * index cost
  index cost = (index vwap - index arrival price)/index arrival price * side * 10000bps

- added value
  to compare the arrival cost with estimated pre-trade cost
  added value = arrival cost - est. pre-trade cost
  
10. trade governance
- best order execution is a tradeoff among
  execution price/ trading cost/ speed/ likelihood of settlement/ order size
- process to monitor execution arrangements
  checkpoints / trading records/ regular reviews
