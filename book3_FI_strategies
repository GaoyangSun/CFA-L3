Reading 20-21

1. changes in yield curve
[1] parallel shift (level)
[2] slope
    spread = yield_long - yield_short
[3] curvature
    butterfly spread = 2 * yield_mid - yield_short - yield_long
- short-term rates are more volatile than long-term
  upward - flattens + less curved
  downward - stepens + more curved

2. strategy - stable yield curve
[1] buy and hold
    in a upward slope, extend maturity to have a higher expected return
[2] riding the yield curve
    in a upward slope, buy long-term and sell it later
                   or, short short-term and long long-term
[3] sell convexity
    if no expected change in yield curve, then convexity is useless
    short bonds with high convexity, long bonds with low convexity
    high: putable
    low: callable, MBS(can prepay)
[4] carry trade
    if no expected change in yield curve, then duration is no harm
    long a long-term bond with low financing cost (issuing a low-yield bond)
    buy bond with repo/ receive fixed, pay float/ long future
