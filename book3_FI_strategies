Reading 20-21

1. changes in yield curve
[1] parallel shift (level)
[2] slope
    spread = yield_long - yield_short
[3] curvature
    butterfly spread = 2 * yield_mid - yield_short - yield_long
- short-term rates are more volatile than long-term
  upward - flattens + less curved
  downward - stepens + more curved

2. strategy - stable yield curve
[1] buy and hold
    in a upward slope, extend maturity to have a higher expected return
[2] riding the yield curve
    in a upward slope, buy long-term and sell it later
                   or, short short-term and long long-term
[3] sell convexity
    if no expected change in yield curve, then convexity is useless
    short bonds with high convexity, long bonds with low convexity
    high: putable
    low: callable, MBS(can prepay)
[4] carry trade
    if no expected change in yield curve, then duration is no harm
    long a long-term bond with low financing cost (issuing a low-yield bond)
    buy bond with repo/ receive fixed, pay float/ long future

3. strategy - yield curve movement
[1] duration mgt
    decrease duration if int rate expected to rise
    increasee duration if int rate expected to fall
[2] buy convexity
    - 涨多跌少
    - methods (keeping duration-neutral)
      by pure bond - long high convexity bond, short low convexity bond
      by embedded option - long putable, short callable
      by portfolios - long barbell, short bullet
      by options - long call/put on bond
      call/put are both convex derivatives
      V_callable = V_pure - V_call
      V_putable = V_pure + V_put
[3] butterfly
    butterfly - long short and long(barbell), short middle(bullet)
    

4. changes - yield curve movement
[1] level change
    - choose the highest return
    total return = TYM_beg + delta_pricePer
    where duration = - delta_pricePer / delta_int
    so, total return = YTM_beg + [-ED_end * delta_int]
                     = YTM_beg + [-ED_end * (YTM_end - YTM_beg)]
                     = (yield income + rolldown return) + delta_pricePer
    - alter convexity
    by the methods above
[2] slope change
    - flattens (short term increase, long term remain or decrease)
      barbell outperforms bullet
      so, long barbell, short bullet
    - flattens (short term decrease, long term remain or increase)
      barbell underperforms bullet
      so, long bullet, short barbell
[3] curvature change
    - more curvature
      barbell outperforms bullet
      so, long barbell, short bullet
    - less curvature
      barbell underperforms bullet
      so, long bullet, short barbell
[4] volatility change
    - volatility increase
      long convexity
    - volatility decrease
      short convexity

5. inter-mkt carry trade
[1] with currency risk
- borrow low int rate currency, lend high int rate currency
- currency swap, receive high int rate currency
- borrow low int rate currency, change into fx and invest, also sign a fx forward contract to repay later

[2] without currency risk
no fx risk because you borrow and invest in the same country, profit comes from yield curve stepness
- receive fixed (long-term) in steep mkt, receive floating (short-term) in flat mkt
- long future in steep mkt, short future in flat mkt

[3] covered int rate parity (CIRP)
invest in base = change into fx(on S) + invest in fx + change back to base(on F)
1 + r_DC = (F/S) * (1 + r_FC)
hedge benefit - comes from using F instead of S_t
(F - S)/S = (F/S) - 1 = r_DC - r_FC

hedged benefit = bond's local mkt return + hedge cost/benefit
