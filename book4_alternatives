Reading 26-27
1. Hedge Funds
- key features
  low regulatory constraints/ flexible mandates/ aggressive exposure/ larger investment universe
  free use of leverage/ liquidity constaints/ higher costs/ lock-up period/ notice period

2. Equity 
[1] long/short - (net long pos)
    specialist L/S managers (sector-specific focus)
    generalist L/S managers
    
[2] (dedicated) short bias - (net short pos)
    dedicated short-selling (only short)
    short-biased (mostly short)
    active short selling (muddy waters mode)

[3] equity mkt neutral 
    pairs trading (long/short 2 stocks)
    stub trading (long/short parent/son company)
    multi-class trading (long/short bond/stock of same company)
by leverage: short bias < long/short < equity mkt neutral

3. event-driven 
[1] soft-catalyst
    make investments when event has not happened
[2] hard-catalyst
    make investments upon event
- merger arbitrage
  [1] cash-for-stock
  Acquiring company buy target company with cash
  - so you should long T
  [2] stock-for-stock
  Acquiring company buy target company with stock
  - so you should long T and short A
- distressed scurities
  bad competiveness/high leverage/poor governance/fraud and irregularities

4. relative-value (FI)
[1] fixed-income arbitrage
    duration/ credit quality/ liquidity/ optionality
    yield curve trade - long/short @ different points on yield curve, to bet on curve flattening or steepening
    carry trade - long high yield and short low yield, e.g. on/off-the-run
[2] convertible bond arbitrage
    long convertible bond, short stocks
    
5. opportunistic
[1] global macro 
top-down 
[2] managed futures
time-series momentum /cross-sectional momentum
- both have high leverage/volatility/liquidity/ right-tailed return/ low correlation with mkt

6. specialist
[1] volatility trading (by option)
time-zone arbitrage (same underlying, different countries)
cross-asset arbitrage (macro-oriented ?)
[2] reinsurance / life settlements
    - low surrender value/ low premium pmts/ high prob
    
7. multi-manager 
[1] FOF
    diversification/ small investments/ low tail risk/ high mgt fee/ high leverage
[2] multi-strategy
    low mgt fee/ efficient TAA/ transparent/ high op risk/ high tail risk

8. conditional factor risk model (like barra)
return of HF ~ alpha + risk factor + dummy variable (0 if normal, 1 if distress) + error
- risk factor
  equity risk/ currency risk/ credit risk/ volatility risk(VIX)
- risk measure
  [1] sharpe ratio/ sortino ratio (downside risk)
  good: managed futures/ equity mkt netural/ global macro/ event-driven
  not so good: fof/ multi-strategy (diversification effect overvalued)
  [2] standard deviation
  good: short-biased/ mkt neutral/ managed future/ fof
  not so good: event-driven/ relative value
  [3] drawdown
  good: global macro/ managed futures/ merger arbitrage/ mkt neutral
  not so good: LS/ event-driven/ relative value
  
9. roles of alternatives
- capital growth/ income generation/ risk diversification/ safety
- diversification
  apprisal value are often used in alternatives, so diversification may be over-estimated
  
10. investment opportunity set
[1] traditional approach
- by liqudity
  FI: cash - bond - private equity
  equity: public - equity HF - private eqioty
  other: commodity - REIT - private real estate - private real asset
- by economy/inflation
  bad/deflation: non-indexed bond (FI)
  bad/high infaltion: indexed bond/ gold
  good/moderate inflation: equity and private credit
  good/high inflation: commodities/ real estate
- pros
  easy to interpret
- cons
  over-estimation of diversification
[2] risk-factor approach
- private equity = public equity
  private credit = public high-yield bond
- pros
  risk-factoe identification/ integrated framework
- cons
  use of historical data - time lag
  
11. considerations
[1] risk
- option-like pattern because of illiquidity and valuation
  so, we cannot assume normally-distributed return
- unable to achieve the target weight because of illiquidity
[2] expected return
- limited validity of data - smoothing
[3] vehicles
- limited partnership - LP + GP
- SMA (separately managed accounts)
- open-ended mutual funds
[4] liqudiity
- drawdown structure
  calldown period - distribution period - termination
[5] expense and fees
- HF - mgt fee@AUM, incentive fee@each year, high-water, hurdle
- PE - mgt fee@committed capital, incentive fee@termination
[6] tax
[7] in-house programs (build)
    intermediaries (buy)
    
12. asset allocation
- to avoid normality assumption in alternatives
  [1] empirically observed returns
  [2] model a fat-tailed distribution
- models
  [1] monte carlo (by risk factors)
  [2] optimization (mean-variance)
  [3] risk factor based optimization
